#RNA Seq Analysis

#Background

Today we examined a published RNA-Seq experiement where airway smooth muscle cells were treated with dexamethasone, a synthetics something with anit-inflammatory effects

##Load the contData and colData


```{r}
counts<-read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", row.names = 1)

metadata <- read.csv("airway_metadata.csv")
```

```{r}
head(counts)
```

```{r}
head(metadata)
```

Side-note: lets check the corespondence of the metadata and count data setup. 

```{r}
metadata[,1]==colnames(counts)


```
or 
```{r}
metadata$id==colnames(counts)
```

We can use the `==` to see if they are the same

```{r}
all( c(T, T, T, T, F))
```

```{r}
all(metadata$id==colnames(counts))
```

```{r}
#View(metadata)
#View(counts)
```

##Compare treated and control.
First we need to access all the control columns in our counts data. 

```{r}
control.inds<-metadata$dex=="control"

control.ids <- metadata[ control.inds, ]$id
```

Use these ids to access just the control columns of our `counts` data

```{r}
head(counts[, control.ids])

```


```{r}
control.mean <-rowMeans(counts[,control.ids])
head(control.mean)
```

Now do this for treated:

```{r}
treated.inds<-metadata$dex=="treated"

treated.ids <- metadata[ treated.inds, ]$id
treated.ids
```

```{r}
head(counts[, treated.ids])
```

```{r}
treated.mean <-rowMeans(counts[,treated.ids])
head(treated.mean)
```

We will combine for bookkeeping purposes

```{r}
meancounts <-data.frame(control.mean, treated.mean)
#meancounts

```
```{r}
nrow(counts)
```
There are `r nrow(counts)` rows/genese in this dataset

##Compare the control and treated

Quick plot of our progress so far

```{r}
plot(meancounts)
```
This data would greatly benefit fron a log transform! Lets plot on a log log scale

```{r}
plot(meancounts, log="xy")
```

We often use log transformations as they make life much nicer in this world... 

```{r}
log2(10/20)
```

```{r}
log2(80/20)
```

Cool. I like log2!

```{r}
#Here we have added a new colum to the dataframe that includes the log2 values of the treated/control.

meancounts$log2fc <-log2(meancounts[,"treated.mean"]/meancounts[,"control.mean"])
head(meancounts)
```


We need to drop the zero count genes!
use the `which()` function

```{r}
head(meancounts[, 1:2])
```

```{r}
head(meancounts[, 1:2]==0)
```


The `which()` function tells us the indices of TRUE entries in a logical vector. 

```{r}
which(c(T,F,T,F,F,T))


```

However, it is not that useful in default mode on our type of multi column input...

```{r}
inds <-which(meancounts[,1:2]==0, arr.ind = TRUE)
```

I only care about the rows here (if there is a zero in any column I will exclude this row eventually).


```{r}
to.rm<-unique(sort(inds[,"row"]))
```

```{r}
head(meancounts[to.rm,])
```
the above are the genes we want to remove
below is the genes we can use:

```{r}
head(meancounts[-to.rm,])
mycounts <-meancounts[-to.rm,]
```
We now have `r nrow(mycounts)`genes remaining
```{r}
nrow(mycounts)
```

How many of these genes are up regulated at the log2 fold-change threshold of +2 or greater

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc > +2)
```
250 genes are upregulated! The Trues are 1 False is 0

```{r}
round((sum(mycounts$log2fc > +2)/nrow(mycounts))*100,2)

```
```{r}
round((sum(mycounts$log2fc < -2)/nrow(mycounts))*100,2)
```
Above is downregulated

#DESeq Analysis


```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

we first need to set up the DESeq input object.

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, 
                              colData=metadata, 
                              design=~dex)
dds
```
Run the DESeq analysis pipeline

```{r}
dds <-DESeq(dds)
```


```{r}
res <-results(dds)
head(res)
```

#A volcano plot 

This is a very common data visualization of this type of data that does not really look like a volcano unfortunately. 

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, res$padj)
```


```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj))
abline(v=c(-2,2), col="gray")
abline(h=-log(0.05),col="blue")

```

#Add annotation data
```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

```

```{r}
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

```{r}
res$symbol <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=row.names(res), # Our genenames
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        # The format of our genenames
                     column="SYMBOL",          # The new format we want to add
                     multiVals="first")

head(res$symbol)
```
```{r}
head(res)
```
#Lets finally save our results

```{r}
write.csv(res, file="allmyresults.csv")
```

#Pathway analysis
Lets try to  bring some biology insight back into this work.
For this we will start with KEGG. 


```{r}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
```


```{r}
# Examine the first 2 pathways in this kegg set for humans
head(kegg.sets.hs, 2)

```

Before we can use KEGG we need to get our gene identifiers in the correct format for KEGG, which is ENTREZ. 

```{r}
head(rownames(res))
```


```{r}
res$entrez <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=row.names(res), # Our genenames
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        # The format of our genenames
                     column="ENTREZID",          # The new format we want to add
                     multiVals="first")

res$genename <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
      keys= row.names(res),
      keytype="ENSEMBL",
      column="GENENAME",
      multiVals= "first")

head(res)
```

```{r}
foldchanges <- res$log2FoldChange
head(foldchanges)
```

Assign names to this vector that are the gene IDs that KEGG wants.

```{r}
names(foldchanges) <-res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now we are ready for the **gage()** function.

```{r}
keggres= gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```


We can look at the attributes() of this or any R object, this function tells you what is in the object.

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```


```{r}
head(keggres$less)
```

Tge pathview() function will add our genes to a KEGG pathway as colored entries:

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa05310")
```
