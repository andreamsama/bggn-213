trying to get sequence alignment data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aln <- read.fasta("FindAGene-Alignment.fst")
aln

```

trying to make sequence identity matrix
```{r}
seq.id <- seqidentity(aln)
seq.id
```
plotting this as a heat map

```{r}
plot.dmat(seq.id, color.palette = mono.colors)
```

tryna get the labels right

```{r}
ids <- basename.pdb(aln$id)
ids
plot.dmat(seq.id, color.palette = mono.colors, labels=ids)

```
trying corrplot instead
```{r}
library(corrplot)
corrplot(seq.id)
```
ok trying just heatmap

```{r}
heatmap(seq.id)
```
welp youre dumb and yay it worked!
